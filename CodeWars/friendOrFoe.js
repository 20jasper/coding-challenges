//INSTRUCTIONS--
/* Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.

If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...

Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]

i.e.

friend ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Mark"] `shouldBe` ["Ryan", "Mark"]

Note: keep the original order of the names in the output.

*/

//SOLUTION--
/* I am going to filter the array for names with length of 4
*/
function friend(friends) {
    return friends.filter(x => x.length === 4)
}
//TESTCASES--
console.log(friend(["Ryan", "Kieran", "Mark"]), ["Ryan", "Mark"]);
console.log(friend(["Ryan", "Jimmy", "123", "4", "Cool Man"]), ["Ryan"]);
console.log(friend(["Jimm", "Cari", "aret", "truehdnviegkwgvke", "sixtyiscooooool"]), ["Jimm", "Cari", "aret"]);
console.log(friend(["Love", "Your", "Face", "1"]), ["Love", "Your", "Face"]);
